# Clocker
A Simple Clock in Node.JS, assisted with Electron.

## What? Is this it?
No. Unless you go into releases and download and extract the source zip.
This is simply the builder.
Pre-built binary files are provided, but may be out of date.
I may add a silent auto-updater to the program. But in the mean time you can build from source or get the pre-built binary.

More details will be added later!
